This house price prediction machine learning model uses 
*Advanced Regression Techniques like DecisionTreeRegressor, 
*AdaBoostRegressor from scikit-learn, 
*XGBRegressor from the XGBoost, 
*LGBMRegressor from the LightGBM library. 
I have used data sets from Kaggle from the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" prediction competition.
